# "Supposing it didnt?"

Taken from probably my most favourite quote of all time - an excerpt from a philosophical discussion between Pooh and Piglet:

"Supposing a tree fell down, Pooh, when we were underneath it?'
'Supposing it didn't,' said Pooh after careful thought.
Piglet was comforted by this."
